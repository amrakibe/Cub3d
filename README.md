# cub3D

Cub3D is a 3D game developed by myself and my friend Youssef as part of the 1337 Cursus program. The game is built using C and the MLX library, and utilizes the technique of ray casting to create an immersive and visually stunning experience.

## Ray Casting

Ray casting is a technique used in computer graphics to render 3D environments and objects. It works by tracing a virtual "ray" from the viewer's eye through each pixel on the screen, and determining which objects in the scene are visible to the viewer. This technique can be used to create realistic lighting and shadows, and also to calculate the distance between the viewer and objects in the scene. It's a very efficient way to render 3D graphics, and has been used in many video games, architectural visualization and 3D modeling software.

## Running the game

To run the game, you will need to have C and the MLX library installed on your computer. The code for the game is available on our Github repository. You can clone the repository and run the following command in the terminal:


for mandatory part
```bash
make
```
then you can run the game by
  ./cub3D maps/map2.cub 
bouns part

```bash
make bonus
```
then you can run the game by
  ./cub3D_bonus maps/map3.cub
